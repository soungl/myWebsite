It is an interdisciplinary project that is currently coauthored by Daniel Lee (economics/data analytics) and Chantalle Forgues (Law).

The project aims to help local businesses quantify their individual risk of being sued for certain claims. New Hampshire business people will then be better able to understand the legal risks associated with their operations, prepare an accurate budget for their legal risk, and make more informed operating decisions (e.g., assess who a “risky” customer and discontinue business with him or her).

Students will gather and organize data relative to all of the recent federal civil lawsuits in New Hampshire and use big data analytics tools to evaluate, quantify, and predict the legal risks to which businesses in New Hampshire are subject, and the costs thereof.
