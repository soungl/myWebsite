EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

It was estimated that:

1. During the period of winter 2015-16 (December – February) and summer/fall 2016 (June – October), travelers spent $115.1 million in the Lincoln Woodstock Chamber Area (Franconia, Lincoln, Woodstock, and Sugar Hill). Of this $115.1 million, $10.6 million resulted directly from the Chamber’s promotional activities. The Chamber spent $175,725 for promotion ads during the same period. This means the Chamber brought $60 dollars in sales to the area’s businesses per every dollar invested. See Table 0.
2. A total of 683 responses were collected. 238 of these 683 respondents, or 35%, reported having seen the Chamber’s promotional ads during all three seasons. And 63 of the 683 respondents, or 9.2%, reported that they were either influenced to visit or to stay longer as a result of the promotional ads during all three seasons. See Table 1.
3. While the region attracts largely domestic travelers during the winter season, it has a significant representation of visitors from outside the country during the summer and fall season. Foreign travelers make up nearly 14% of all visitors to the region during the summer and fall season. The United Kingdom is by far the largest foreign market for the area’s tourism industry. The largest proportion of domestic travelers come from the northeastern region of the country. See Table 2.
4. During the winter season, Cannon Mountain Website was seen by the greatest number, with 21 respondents or 9% of the total sample. It was followed by Loon Mountain Magazine–Lodging Guide (8%) and the White Mountains Attractions Travel Guide Ad (7%). During the summer and fall season, Western White Mountains Area Map & Guide was seen by the greatest number, with 101 respondents or 22% of the total sample. It was followed by White Mountains Attractions Travel Guide Ad (15.2%) and the White Mountains Attractions Website Banner Ad (8.9%). See Table 3.
5. During the winter season, 21% of 128 respondents from Massachusetts said that they saw one or more of the Chamber’s ads. During the summer and fall season, 39% of 396 domestic respondents said that they saw one or more of the Chamber’s ads. Massachusetts, the largest domestic market, reported 36%. Among foreign travelers, 28% of 25 British respondents said that they saw one or more of the Chamber’s ads, while 50% of 14 German Travelers did. See Table 4. 
6. During the winter season, the Loon Mountain “Basecamp” Online Ad was found to be the most effective with a conversion rate of 2.6% (6 of 223 respondents). It was closely followed by the Cannon Mountain Website with 2.3%. During the summer and fall season, the White Mountains Attractions Travel Guide Ad was found to be the most effective with a conversion rate of 5.3% (24 of 460 respondents). See Table 5. 
7. During the winter season, the White Mountains Attractions Travel Guide Ad was found to be the most cost effective by converting 5 respondents per $1,000 spent for the ad. During the summer and fall season, the White Mountains Attractions Website Banner Ad was found to be the most cost-effective by converting about 61 respondents per $1,000 spent for the ad. See Table 6.
8. During the winter season, 14 respondents, or about 6.2 percent of all 223 respondents, reported that they were influenced to visit or stay longer as a result of the ads. Massachusetts, the area’s largest market, reported a 5% conversion rate. During the summer and fall season, 12% of 396 domestic respondents said that they were influenced to visit or stay longer as a result of the ads. Massachusetts reported 12%. Among foreign travelers, 2% of 25 British respondents said that they were influenced to visit or stay longer as a result of the ads, while 8% of 14 German Travelers did. See Table 7.
