* Direct spending supported 11,606 jobs and generated household income of over $200 million.
* Direct spending produced $43.8 million in state and local government revenues.
* Agriculture’s total economic impact was over $2.3 billion (including direct,indirect,and induced spending).
* A total of 18,326 jobs are linked to agriculture - resulting in nearly $600 million in household income.
